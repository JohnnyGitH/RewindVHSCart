RewindVHS Cart Demo Version 1.0

Project RewindVHS is basic platform I will try to reuse to give some semblance of theme.

This online store application rents VHS movies and has a number of movies in the store for users to browse through and rent. 

Users can view the products on a product page and by clicking on the MOVIES button in the NavBar at the top of the page or by
clicking on the VHS COLLECTION button below the ORDER heading.

Once the user arrives at the gallery of VHS films, as the user hovers over a product, it is highlighted. Each product lists 
the Movie Title , the Movies MainCast , Movies Price and a "RENT" button used to select a specific VHS film.

The user clicks 'RENT' on the product and the user will be redirected to the shopping cart. The product that was selected will 
be added the shopping cart and here it will display the products Image , Movie Name  , Movie Price , Quantity and subtotal 
based off the Quantity. At the bottom of the products in the cart is the 'TOTAL' price of all the items in the cart.

Users can then click on the "Return To Shopping Cart" below the cart and then are redirected back to the gallery of VHS films.
If the user returns to the gallery of VHS films and selects the same film as before, instead of adding a whole new line to the
cart, the cart will increment the Quantity value of the existing product in the cart.

Once a User has added anything to their cart, a new link appears in the Top Right hand side of the NavBar called "Cart" and will
redirect the user back to their shopping cart whenever they need to. Right next to the "Cart" link appears a number that displays
the total number of items in the cart

Additionally , the "RewindVHS" link in the Top Left will always redirect the user back to the "Home Page".
